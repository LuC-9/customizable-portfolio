## What is a Server Action?

A Server Action is an asynchronous function executed on the server, designed for handling data mutations (e.g., form submissions, API calls) directly from React components, serve as a built-in remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism. It eliminates the need for separate API routes, enabling seamless integration of server-side logic with client-side interactions.

<br />
**Key features:**

- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works even if JavaScript is disabled.
- **Caching & Revalidation:** Integrates with Next.js caching (e.g., `revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag`).
- **Security:** Uses encrypted IDs and CSRF protection by default.

### How to Create a Server Action

One of the steps to create a server action is to create a file with `'use server'`. This tells Next.js to treat the file as a server action.

```ts
// app/actions.ts
'use server';
export async function deletePost(postId: string) {
  // Delete post from database
  await db.post.delete({ where: { id: postId } });
  revalidatePath('/posts'); // Update cache
}
```

You can then import and use it in your React client components.

```tsx
'use client';
import { deletePost } from '@/app/actions';

export function DeleteButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {
  return <button onClick={() => deletePost(postId)}>Delete</button>;
}
```

## The Core Principle: Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

<img src="/images/server-actions-under-the-hood/server-action-flow.png" alt="Server Action Flow" />

At their core, Server Actions implement an RPC pattern using HTTP POST requests. When you write:

```ts
"use server";  
export async function createPost(data: FormData) {  
  // Database interaction  
}  

```

Next.js performs these critical operations:

1. **Server-Side Registration**: During the build process, Next.js scans for functions marked with `"use server"`. Each such function is registered in an internal “action registry” with a unique action ID.
2. **Client-side proxy generation**: Instead of sending the entire function code to the client, Next.js generates a lightweight client proxy. This proxy is merely a thin layer that, when called, packages the function’s arguments (after serialization) and triggers a `POST` request.
3. **Security wrapping**: Adds automatic *CSRF protection* for requests. 


And finally, when the server action is invoked from the client like this:

```tsx
<form action={createPost}>  
  <input name="content" />  
  <button>Submit</button>  
</form>  
```
When the client invokes the proxy (e.g., from a button click or a form submission), the browser submits a POST request with the action ID and serialized headers, the whole process is as follows:

<br/>
**1. Serialization of function's arguments**: 
- FormData is encoded using [`multipart/form-data`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)
- Non-form invocations use JSON.stringify() with [SuperJSON](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) for rich type support

**2. Request Dispatch**: 
The proxy sends a POST request to a hidden endpoint with the action ID and serialized parameters.

```bash
POST /createPost HTTP/1.1  
Content-Type: multipart/form-data  
X-Action: "ACTION_ID"  
X-Forwarded-Host: example.com  
...
```
**3. Server Processing**: The server intercepts the request, and:

- Next.js runtime matches the `X-Action` header to registered functions.
- Deserializes payload using inverse of client-side encoding.
- Executes within isolated server context (no client dependencies).

**4. Response Handling**:

- The output is serialized and returned to the client.
- The client proxy receives the response and continues execution as if it were a direct function call.

This remote procedure call (RPC) pattern means that—despite the illusion of a direct function call—every server action is performing a network round-trip over HTTP behind the scenes. The beauty of this abstraction is that it eliminates the need to manually create and maintain separate API endpoints for many common operations.

### Security Architecture
Server Actions implement enterprise-grade security by default:

#### CSRF Protection
- **Automatic CSRF tokens**: Each server action request includes a unique [CSRF token](https://brightsec.com/blog/csrf-token/) in the headers.
- Signed double-submit cookies with `__Host-` prefix
- Strict origin matching via `Sec-Fetch-Site` header validation

#### Payload Validation
- **Type safety**: TypeScript types are enforced on the server side.
```ts
// Next.js generates runtime validation from TypeScript types:  
if (typeof data.content !== "string") {  
  throw new ActionError("Invalid payload");  
}  
```
<Callout icon={<Icons.InfoIcon />} type='danger'>
#### No runtime type safety
Always validate server action inputs with [`Zod`](https://zod.dev/), as TypeScript types alone don’t provide runtime safety.
</Callout>

#### Isolation Boundaries
- **Server-side isolation**: Server actions run in a separate Node.js process, isolated from the client runtime.
- Timeouts enforced via [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html).


### Conclusion
Server Actions represent a fundamental shift in web architecture, enabling developers to build full-stack applications with minimal boilerplate. By abstracting away the complexities of network communication and security.
