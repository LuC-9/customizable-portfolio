## What is availabilty?
Availabilty of an application refers to the percentage of the time application provides operations expected from it, and is accessible to all the users.

### Measuring Availability
- Availability is measured as percentage of uptime over a given period, usually a month or a year.
- The formulae is typically `Availability = (Total Service Time - Downtime) / (Total Service Time)`
- The value is expected to be extremely close to `100%` i.e. `99%+`, the higher the better..

## 9s of Availability
Availability is generally represented as the **numbers of 9s** in the _fractional_ plus _integer_ part of the availabilty (eg. a service with `99.99%` availability is described as having _four 9s_).
<br/>
The availabilty percentage value is usually very high `99%+` , as any value lesser than that will lead to very significant downtime for the applications.
<br />
Here's a representation of how much different availability percentages equals to actual downtime per year.
<br />
**99.9% availability - three 9s**

| Duration           | Acceptable downtime |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Downtime per year  | 8h 45min 57s        |
| Downtime per month | 43m 49.7s           |
| Downtime per week  | 10m 4.8s            |
| Downtime per day   | 1m 26.4s            |

**99.99% availability - four / quad 9s**

| Duration           | Acceptable downtime |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Downtime per year  | 52min 35.7s         |
| Downtime per month | 4m 23s              |
| Downtime per week  | 1m 5s               |
| Downtime per day   | 8.6s                |

## Availability of connected components
When multiple components are connected together the availability of the system starts to depend on the components that it's made of.
<br/>
In your application's architecture, you have a couple of ways to connect components together.

### 1. Components connected in Sequence
When components are connected in a sequence, the functioning of a component directly depends on response or data of other components.
<br />
e.g. Consider a normal 3 tier application, consisting of only 3 servers (frontend, backend and database) where functioning of the application / frontend depends on the response from the backend server and the response from the backend server depends upon the response from the database.
<br />
i.e. in this case, _if the database is down it will make the whole application unresponsive._
<br/>
Overall **availability of the system decreases** when two components with _availability < 100%_ are in sequence.
<br/>
`Availability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)`
<br/>
This multiplication occurs because the _probabilities of all components being available must be combined_.
<br/>
e.g. If `Foo` crashes for 3 times a day, and `Bar` crashes 4 times a day. Your whole system will be unavailable for `3*4 = 12` times a day.
The system becomes unavailable if either of the `Foo` or `Bar` are down, thus decreasing the availability even more.
<br/>
If both `Foo` and `Bar` each had `99.9%` availability, their total availability in sequence would be `99.8%`.

### 2. Components connected in Parallel
When components are connected in parallel, the application depends on multiple copies of each component, rather than a single component, thus _removing the direct dependecy between the components._
<br/>
e.g. Consider the same 3 tier application as before, but there exists a copy of each server in a different <a target="blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-availability-zones.html">AZs</a>.
<br/>
i.e. in this case, _if the database is down, the application will failover to the database hosted in the other AZ_, the application will be unresponsive only if databases are down in both AZs. 
<br/>
Overall **availability increases** when two components with availability < 100% are in parallel.
<br/>
`Availability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))`
<br/>
Here, the formulae is different because this _formula calculates the probability that not all components will fail simultaneously_. i.e The system's is only unavailable if either system is down, thus making the availability even more than either `foo` or `bar`.
<br/>
If both `Foo` and `Bar` each had `99.9%` availability, their total availability in parallel would be `99.9999%`.

## Conclusion
If you want to make your application more available, you can introduce redundency in your architecture. 

Calculating availability beforehand helps you efficitvely communicate availability with your team and helps business commit to realistic <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/itsm/what-is-sla.html">SLAs</a>.
